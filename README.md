# HMS Victory 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **Python 3.8+**: The bot is built using Python, requiring a compatible version.
*   **Discord Bot Token**: Get this from the Discord Developer Portal.
*   **OpenAI API Key**:  Needed for features like translation and the roast command.
*   **Chromium**: Required by certain commands.
*   **Dependencies**: Install required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    The `requirements.txt` file is created/updated using:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

### Environment Setup

1.  **Environment Variables**:  Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory.  Add these lines, replacing placeholders with your actual keys:

    ```
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
    OPENAI_TOKEN=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

2.  **Configuration Files**: The bot uses several JSON files for data storage (e.g., `thread_messages.json`, `added_users.json`, `chat_leaderboard.json`, `persistent_views.json`, and files in the `daily_summaries` directory).  Make sure these files exist. Some are created automatically, but you might need to manually create empty files for others.

3. **Folder Structure**: Ensure you have created all the folders in the structure that is shown at the top of the Python file.

### Running the Bot

1.  **Navigate**:  Open a terminal/command prompt and go to the `HMS-Victory` directory.
2.  **Execute**: Run the bot:

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    bash start.sh
    ```

The bot should connect to Discord and start if set up correctly.

*   Image caching stores images sent in the server for faster logging of deleted images.
*   The bot uses `apscheduler` for scheduling.
